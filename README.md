# Biological data visualization

Biological data visualization is a branch of bioinformatics concerned with scientific information visualization to different areas of the life sciences. this includes visualization of sequences, genomes, alignments, phylogenies, macromolecular structures, systems biology, microscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging data.

### Types of Plots in Bioinformatics
A Manhattan plot is a type of plot, usually used to display data with a large number of data-points, many of non-zero amplitude, and with a distribution of higher-magnitude values. The plot is commonly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to display significant SNPs.

In GWAS Manhattan plots, genomic coordinates are displayed along the **x-axis**, with the negative **logarithm** of the association p-value for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) displayed on the **y-axis**, meaning that each dot on the Manhattan plot signifies a SNP. Because the strongest associations have the smallest p-values (e.g., 10 to the power−15), their negative logarithms will be the greatest (e.g., 15). The different colors of each block usually show the extent of each chromosome.

It is a good way to visualize thousands to millions of SNPs on a genome-scale. The lowest the p value (higher −log10[p]), highest is the association of a given SNP with trait or disease.
